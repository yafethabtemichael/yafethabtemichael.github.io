<p>
    Question 1:<br> Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):<br>
    Answer:<br> 10,8,8,9,10,1
</p>

    Question 2:<br> What is the difference between a method and function?<br>
    Answer:<br> A function is a group of reusable code.Functions are defined in structural language and methods are defined in object oriented languages.
    Functions are independent, they can be called without having an object, but methods are not independent. you can not
    call them without the object reference.

    Question 3:<br> What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?<br>
    Answer:<br>The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name
    (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).
    'this' can be used inside the Method or constructor of Class. It(this) works as a reference to
    the current Object.

    Question 4:<br> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?<br>
    Answer:<br> By default the execution context for an execution is global which means that if a code is being executed as
    part of a simple function call then “this” refers to global object.
</p>

<p>
    Question 5:<br> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?<br>
    Answer:<br> In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of
    this will become the new object when a new object is created.<br>
    The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.

    Question 6:<br> Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing
    keyword 'this'. When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
    Answer:<br> 'this' refers to the x object.

    Question 7:<br> What is a free variable in JavaScript?<br>
    Answer:<br> Free variables are simply the variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter.<br>
    In javascript closures, those are simply the variables that the function takes (read and write) in the enclosing
    scope where is declared the closure or in a parent scope.

<p>Question 8:<br> Create an object that has properties with name = "fred"
    and major="music" and a property that is a function
    that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two,
    or the square of the two if they are equal.<br>
    Answer :
    <br>var tempObject = {<br>
    name: "fred",<br>
    major: "Music",<br>
    smallest: function (a, b) {<br>
    if (a === b) {<br>
    return a * a;<br>
    } else if (a < b) {<br>
    return a;<br>
    } else {<br>
    return b;<br>
    }<br>
    }<br>
    };<br>

    console.log(tempObject.smallest(1, 2));

<p>Question 9:<br> Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects
    using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.<br>
    Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position<br>
    Answer: <br>
    function Employee(name, salary, position) {<br>
    this.name = name;<br>
    this.salary = salary;<br>
    this.position = position;<br>
    }<br>
    <br>
    var e1 = new Person("Mihre", 120000, "Software Developer");<br>
    var e2 = new Person("Habtom", 110000, "Programmer");<br>
    var e3 = new Person("brhane", 130000, "Developer");<br>
</p>

    <p>Question 10:<br>  Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments
        and returns the product of the arguments.<br>
        Answer :
        <br>function multiply(a, b) {<br>
        let ans =1; for(let i=0;i<arguments.lenght;i++){
        ans=ans*arguments[i]}
        return ans;
        return a*b;<br>
        }<br>
        console.log(multiply(5, 10));<br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Question 11:<br>  Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.<br>
        Answer :
        <br>le fmax=(a,b,c)=>{<br>
        let max=a;<br>
        if(b>a) max=b;<br>
        if(c>max)max=c;<br>
        return max;
